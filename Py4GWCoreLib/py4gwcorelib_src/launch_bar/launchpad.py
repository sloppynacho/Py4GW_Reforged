"""Launchpad host callback (moved out of Py4GW_widget_manager).

The launchpad (LaunchBar) is the widget-manager UI. It renders through its own
native Draw callback named "Launchpad" -- separate from the host -- so the
profiler attributes it to a "Launchpad" metric rather than folding it into the
host's per-frame work.

It is NOT a WidgetManager widget, but it opts into profiling the same way any
callback can: the render is routed through ProfilingRegistry.runcall_scope (so an
on-demand cProfile capture can time it), and the name is declared profilable via
ProfilingRegistry().register(). That is what lets tools like the System Monitor
offer a deep profile of the launchpad without treating it as a widget.
